  Connection Between Syllabus and Video
 </h1>
 
  <p>
   Throuout the video Mayuko lays out multiple expectations versus reality of the software engineer workplace. With that realitys
   she stated included,
  </p>
  
   <ol>
    <li> Collaborating with all diffrent types of people. </li>
    <li> The kind of collaboration that they have. </li>
    <li> Soft skills are greater valued then technical skills. </li>
    <li> You want to like the people you work with. </li>
    <li> You dont have to be a certain person to be a successful software engineer. You can be your authentic self. </li>
    <li> Role models are very important </li>
    <li> Advice for new graduate: It does not end with a degree, will continue to learn more everyday. </li>
