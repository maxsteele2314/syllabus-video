  Connection Between Syllabus and Video
 </h1>
 
  <p>
   Throuout the video Mayuko lays out multiple expectations versus reality of the software engineer workplace. With that realitys
   she stated included,
  </p>
  
   <ol>
    <li> Collaborating with all diffrent types of people. </li>
    <li> The kind of collaboration that they have. </li>
    <li> Soft skills are greater valued then technical skills. </li>
    <li> You want to like the people you work with. </li>
    <li> You dont have to be a certain person to be a successful software engineer. You can be your authentic self. </li>
    <li> Role models are very important </li>
    <li> Advice for new graduate: It does not end with a degree, will continue to learn more everyday. </li>
    
 <p>
  While Mayuko lays out some basic reality's our syllabus takes a more direct route of laying out the ground rules
  of what is expected of us througghout the course. These expectations include,
 </p>
    
   <ol>
    <li> Objectives </li>
    <li> How to reach Dr. Bradshaw </li>
    <li> Materials </li>
    <li> Attendance </li>
    <li> Peer assessment </li>
    <li> Grading, see below </li>
   </ol>
    
    <table>
     <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th scope="col"> Grade Percentage </th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <th scope="row"> Before Class Prep Work:</th>
      <td>10%</td>
     </tr>
      <tr>
      <th scope="row"> Assigned in Class Work:</th>
      <td>15%</td>
     </tr>
      <tr>
      <th scope="row"> Diligent Assessment of Peers:</th>
      <td>5%</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <th scope="row"> Tests:</th>
      <td>10%,15%,25%</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <th scope="row"> Projects:</th>
      <td>20%</td>
     </tr>
    </table>

   After both watching Mayuko talk about the realities of the industry as well as reading the syllabus their are some
  clear overlapping points. As stated in both sources a productive and positive person is an essential factor to being
  an successful student or employee. Collaboration is crucial in both creating solid and well proofed programs as well 
  as helping a fellow classmates by reading over their code or helping them understand a concept tthat they may struggle
  with. I also believe that some of the core expectations of the classroom translate simutaniously to the work place.
  Clearly attendance, work ethic, teamwork are all crucial aspects of both settings. Failing to abide by those standards 
  will either result in a poor grade or worse being fired from your job. The only suggestion I have for the syllabus is the
  addition of a more day to day classroom schedule. While clearly no one knows exactly what we will do everyday I believe their
  could be a little bit more explanation then what the learning objectives cover. Overall im excited to finally dive into the
  computer science world throughout this course.
